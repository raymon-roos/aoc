## Advent of Code solutions 🎇

Starting with the 2025 edition, and perhaps I'll go back and do some older ones. I'm
interested in Rust, Gleam, and Haskell. I might attempt some puzzles multiple times in
different languages.

## How to use

This repository features Nix flakes with a development shell for each language.
